# Anomaly Detection in Credit Card Transactions using Power BI

## About the Project

This project focuses on developing a Power BI dashboard to detect anomalies in credit card transactions. Anomaly detection is crucial for identifying fraudulent activities and ensuring the security of transactions. Leveraging Power BI's data visualization and analytical capabilities, the dashboard provides insights into transaction patterns and identifies potential anomalies.

## Features

- **Interactive Dashboard**: An intuitive and visually appealing layout with charts, tables, and filters.
- **Data Overview**: Visualizations of transaction statistics, including total transactions, average transaction amount, and transaction frequency.
- **Anomaly Visualization**: Highlighting potential anomalies using line charts, scatter plots, and heat maps.
- **Merchant Analysis**: Identifying merchants with the highest number of transactions and those with high occurrences of fraudulent transactions.

## Files in the Repository

- **Anomaly_Detection_in_CC_Report.pdf**: Contains the Power BI dashboard, visualizations, and summary.
- **Anomaly_Detection_in_CreditCard_Transactions.pbix**: The Power BI file used to create the dashboard.

## How to Use

1. **Launch Power BI**: Open the `Anomaly_Detection_in_CreditCard_Transactions.pbix` file in Power BI.
2. **Explore the Dashboard**: Interact with the visualizations to gain insights into transaction patterns and anomalies.
3. **Read the Report**: Refer to the `Anomaly_Detection_in_CC_Report.pdf` to view the exported report from PowerBI dashboard.
